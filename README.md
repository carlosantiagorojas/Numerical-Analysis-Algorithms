# Numerical Analysis algorithms

Implementation of some basic numerical analysis algorithms in MATLAB. It follows the book structure of "Numerical Analysis" by Burden and Faires (not the algorithms implementation).

## Algorithms
- Bisection Method
- Gauss Elimination with Partial Pivoting
- Gauss Elimination with Scaled Partial Pivoting
- LU Factorization
